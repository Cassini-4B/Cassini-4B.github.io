## What is RPCA?
RPCA stands for Robust Principal Component Analysis.  It's a statistical adjustment of the standard PCA model that allows for its application (among other use cases) in detecting outliers.  I first came across RPCA when researching how to detect anomalies or novelties in extremely noisy time series data.  It's an interesting concept, which is elegant in its simplicity and consists of a singular value matrix decomposition into the sum of low rank and sparse matrices.  It takes advantage of the fact that PCA tends to be sensitive to outliers, (because outliers will effect the rank estimate of the low-dimensional subspace/manifold), so adjusting PCA to be robust to outliers allows for the distillation of anomalies from the intrinsic pattern in the data.  


When I first applied RPCA, I ran into the indentifiability issue where the low-rank matrix was also sparse, which made it difficult to tell if the sparse matrix was not also low-rank.  The key to keep in mind here the incoherence assumption, which asserts that the singular vectors need to be reasonably spread out and the sparcity pattern of the sparse matrix is uniformly selected at random.    


Because of the ubiqity of noisy time series data, RPCA has many practical applications in data science and machine learning.  I've applied it to detecting anomalies in time series sensor and signal data, but it can also be applied in:


### Video/Imagery Analysis

Decomposing imagery data into low-rank and sparse matrices allows for the disentanglement of stationary background pixels and objects in the foreground.  Batch processing or stacking frames allows for application to video imagery analysis.



### Facial Recognition

Facial recognition technology has advanced significantly over the years, such that a low-rank representation of faces is sufficient enough for machine recognition.  However, almost all real-world imagery suffers from imagery distortion, aberrations, variation in lighting and resolution and many other anomalies.  RPCA can be used to improve facial recognition algorithm performance through the filtering out these outliers and anomalies.  



### Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems

This application of RPCA is pretty interesting to me, because it involves reducing the target user and object space to low rank manifolds that describe the inherent behaviors within the system.  Recommendations are then made by identifying object and user pairs that reside in proximity to each other in the low dimensional space.  But as usual, these systems depend on large quantities of data on user behaviour and data that has a high enough resolution to be able to meaningfully distinguish patterns between individual users.  Identifying outliers in this space can improve upon these algorithms, but more interestingly, can identify new and untapped business markets or customer segments that could open up new opportunities for growth and expansion.  



### Document Indexing

RPCA can also be used in conjunction with LSA (latent semantic analysis) topic modeling for a set of documents in a dataset.  Each document is vectorized by using a numerical statistic (such as TF/IDF) that encodes the significance of a particular word in a corpus of words by examining its frequency of occurance in that document.  These vectors (matrices) can be decomposed into a low rank matrix (which best describes the underlying content) and a sparse matrix (which captures outliers).  Comparing these matrices exposes common words used in all the documents, as well as keywords that distinguishes between the documents.  


Cheers!
