title: PyKafka-- Kafka client for Python

## What is pyKafka?

If you've ever attempted to use Kafka with a python consumer and thought--"there has to be a better way to do this", look no further than PyKafka:

It's a user friendly Kafka client for python, and provides a great substitute to the JVM Kafka client that exposes a pythonic API for easy application in any python environment, including jupyter notebooks.  Data gets streamed in directly from the source through Kafka, and PyKafka serves as the client with which python consumers can ingest the data.  From there it's a simple matter of applying standard EDA (exploratory data analysis) on your streamed data to examine, visualize and generate predictions.  





Cheers!
