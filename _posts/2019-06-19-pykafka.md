title: PyKafka-- Kafka client for Python

## What is pyKafka?

If you've ever attempted to use Kafka with a python consumer and thought--"there has to be a better way to do this", look no further than PyKafka:

It's a user friendly Kafka client for python, and provides a great substitute to the JVM Kafka client that exposes a pythonic API for easy application in any python environment, including jupyter notebooks.  Data gets streamed in directly from the source through Kafka, and PyKafka serves as the driver with which python consumers can identify which Kafka brokers to talk to, make any reconnections, cluster reconfigurations or retry requests as necessary, and ingest the data.  From there it's a simple matter of applying standard EDA (exploratory data analysis) on your streamed data to examine, visualize and generate predictions.  

For plotting of streaming real time data in python, you have several options, one of which is to use dash and plotly for live dynamic visualizations of streaming data:

Dash is useful because you can graph data that constantly updates through a kafka topic and consumer setup.  There are interval parameters that let you control how often your graph will be updated, and setting an event in Dash will trigger any customised update function that you create to refresh your graph with new data.  Since Dash is written on top of plotly (along with Flask and React.js), you have all the same web interface functionality as plotly, which is really handy for deployment in a server and for sharing via urls.  It's also cross-platform and mobile ready, and is open source (although enterprise deployment requires a license).  

Now, in all fairness, there are indeeed other tools besides PyKafka that provide Kafka implementations in python.  As of this writing, [kafka-python](https://pypi.org/project/kafka-python) and [Confluent-kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/confluent-kafka-python/) are two additional options for python libraries in Kafka.  In my humble opinion, kakfa-python isn't as user friendly, and confluent requires some overhead that might be more than you'd like to invest if you just want a simple, straightforward application of Kafka for your system.  However, for a more detailed investigation of the three libraries (including notes on configuations and statistics on performance), here's a great blog that lists specifics about each tool and how they compare with each other: [Notes on Kafka in Python](matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2017/10/10/kafka-python).
