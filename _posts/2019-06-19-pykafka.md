## What is pyKafka?

<img src="/pics/pykafka.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%;">

If you've ever attempted to use Kafka with a python consumer and thought--"there has to be a better way to do this", look no further than PyKafka:

[PyKafka](https://pykafka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

It's a user friendly Kafka client for python, and provides a great substitute to the JVM Kafka client that exposes a pythonic API for easy application in any python environment, including jupyter notebooks.  




Cheers!
