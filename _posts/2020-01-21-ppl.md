It can sometimes be a challenge to keep current with the latest in AI and machine learning, particularly if you're heads down in your work and you are bound by operational constraints.  So I thought I would spend the next couple entries looking at some of the newer approaches in machine learning and provide an overview of their uses and benefits.  The first of these will be about Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPL).

## What is Probabilistic Programming?
To start with, let's explore the concept of probabilistic programming.  In its simplest form, probabilstic programming is a convergence of computer science, machine learning and Bayesian inference.  It seeks to essentially program probabilistic models-- to construct and define models and then automatically generate statistical inferences through the application of algorithmic computation.  The languages that provide the ability to create these programs are known as probabilistic programming languages (PPL).  

## Why use PPLs?
If you're familiar with Bayesian methods, then most likely you're aware of the enormous time and effort it takes to solve for the posteriors in a particular problem, especially in cases involving big data or those with high dimensionality.  Often, in problems like these where the inference is intractable, you're faced with applying complicated algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (and hard coding them) to approximate the posteriors.  

As an alternative, PPLs offer you the convenience of leveraging machine learning to automate solving for the posteriors.  The key to their usefulness is that they provide the flexibility of <i>working backwards from observed data.</i>  In traditional Bayesian problems, you hard code in specified and known rules to arrive at an estimated probability.  With PPLs however, you can switch from a simulation perspective to instead generating inferences by using probability data to derive the underlying posteriors that describe the inherent relationships.  This provides much more functionality in datasets with high ambiguity and uncertainty and offers additional opportunities for capturing latent dependencies.

## A Caveat
One thing I do want to note though, is that PPLs are currently an open research question.  The current landscape of PPLs is certainly rich and diverse, but there are variations in the levels of quality and applicability of the options available today.  Also, there are still challenges involved in the level of expressiveness and performance of each of the available languages, and there's a learning curve involved in determining which language is suitable for you.  You may find you'll need to apply different PPLs per problem, depending on what types of probabilistic models you need or how many random variables you'll want to take into account.  But the potential of PPLs to revolutionize Bayesian computing is definitely there, and it will be exciting to see what the next breakthroughs will be in this field.
