Who doesn't love Jarvis?  This is one of those times where I'm thinking: 'I wonder what it would take to build Jarvis?'  (Well, at least the question-answering part of him, not the part that can build me a flying weaponized suit of armour).  In keeping with the actual Jarvis, I've decided to make him:
<img src="/pics/jarvis_reading.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
1) Well Read:  I downloaded the Kaggle 'All the News' dataset, which consists of about 145,000 news articles taken from 2016-2017 from different American news outlets (CNN, Breitbart, NY Times, NPR etc).

2) Clean: I 'cleaned' the dataset by pre-processing the article text: removing punctuation, removing stopwords, lowercasing and stemming words (using NLTK's porter stemmer).

3) Organized:  After using count vectorizer on my cleaned text, I used an LDA model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to do some topic modelling on the dataset.  I also used google's word to vec model to obtain document vectors for each article, and clustered the dataset using kmeans to obtain 250 different clusters in order to segment out domains on which I could  focus queries.  My goal was to use these domains as constraints for my queries, so that I could use a distance metric to retrieve responses from extracted summaries of articles in that specific domain.


## Jarvis v0.1

Jarvis is unfortunately Trump obsessed.

The bar chart above shows the top 25 words in the dataset, and by far the word 'Trump' stands out the most, as it occurred almost twice as many times and the next common word in the dataset.  Also in the top were 'Clinton' and 'Republican', which makes sense considering that these were articles published in 2016 during the campaign and election.  But this presented a major obstacle to my strategy, as my plans depended upon having clear distinctive clusters or topics into which I could segment my dataset.  So I decided to change my strategy to making Jarvis an article recommender instead, where he could identify the 3 nearest neighbors to the input query vector and return the titles of those articles in speech format.

## Flask App
![alt_text](/pics/jarvis_flask.png)  
Here's my Jarvis Flask app.  If you input text of an article you've read, it will return the titles of 3 related articles to read (a random choice of 3 out of 10 nearest neighbors via cosine distance).  Also in this app is a voice synthesizer (using marytts) that will read aloud the message in the right hand side box (in a British accent, of course).  I tried using Google's tts API but that was giving me an MP3 and I would have had to find a way to play that MP3 concurrently with rendering my message html page.  So marytts provided a perfect solution to having both the message and synthesized voice render/play at the same time.  I also liked looking into how voice synthesis works--the message text is analyzed for structure to determine timing, pauses and inflections (using pos tagging and chunking).  Then the graphemes are converted to phonemes to speak the message out loud. Isn't that cool?

Cheers!
