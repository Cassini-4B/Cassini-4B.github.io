I just found a cool new tool for lightweight NLP processing in python: 
[TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

It's a Python library (for both Python 2 and 3) that is easy to install and implement.  The documentation page has great tutorials that get you set up and running pretty quickly:
[Installation](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/install.html)

Since it's been pretty easy to get set up, I was able to run with some simple text processing:

   * Noun-phrase extraction
   * POS Tagging
   * Sentiment Analysis
   * Language Translation
   * Text Summary

This was my first real hands-on (from scratch) NLP task, so it was fun to go through and see all these steps in motion. If you'd like to walk through my adventure in TextBlob, here's my jupyter notebook:

Thanks!
