For the first project in the Bootcamp, we were tasked with following objective:

 _Your client (WTWY : Women Tech Women Yes) is a non-profit group that wants to reach as many people as possible to generate interest in their cause and attend their gala that will take place in the lower East side of NYC in June of 2019.  Which stations in the NYC subway system would be the best station to position their volunteers to reach as many people as possible?_

-----

We started with obtaining data on number of riders per station per turnstile, for one week from the MTA:

From there, we needed to do several groupby and aggregations to get the total riders per station over the 3 weeks of data we looked at.

### Results

Based on ridership alone, Grand Central was at the top of our list of recommendations, with just over 2 million riders in a 3 week period.  This was followed by 42nd Street Port Authority and Times Square. 


### Supplemental Data 

In addition we found the latitude and longitude coodinates for each subway station in our data.

In order to add value to the data, we looked up US census data that gave us median household income, education level and female population for the NYC area (by census tract and congressional district).

After converting census tract location codes (GEOID10) to latitude longitude coordinates, we were able to merge the two dataframes and from there we were able to perform our analysis in determining which stations maximized rider counts, education level, income level and number of females in the area.

We also created an interactive web application that our clients can use to drill down and look at the top 12 stations themselves:
