  Hey there! It's a big world out there, with lots to see and do, connections to make and new horizons to pursue.  So it's been my life goal to explore, investigate, and seek out new adventures.  This time I'm on an adventure into Data Science.  This is a blog that I'm starting as a student in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp and I hope I can fill it's pages with somewhat useful or at least interesting thoughts on data, science, and discovery.
