  Hey there! It's a big world out there, with lots to see and do so it's been my life goal to explore and seek out new adventures.  This time I'm on an adventure into Data Science.  This is a blog that I'm starting as a student in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp and I hope I can fill it's pages with somewhat useful or at least interesting Data Science thoughts.

##h2 Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Lots of rough drafts 
* Not enough sleep
* Frequent questioning of life choices



Thanks for reading!
