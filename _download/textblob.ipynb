Mrs May said the UK visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security.Along with trade and security links, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East.Ahead of Mr Trump\\'s visit, Mrs May said that when the UK leaves the European Union \"there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead\".\\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nGetty Images\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    The US President and First Lady were greeted by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, the Queen\\'s representative and the chief operating officer of Stansted Airport\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nGetty Images\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    They then departed on Marine One to travel to the US Ambassador in central London\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Media captionSome of Mr Trump\\'s supporters and protesters have been explaining their motivation\\nMr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday \"may be the easiest\" part of his European trip.Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump\\'s decision to \"engage\" with the Russian leader.But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the \"malign behaviour\" of Russia.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalysisBy James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondentSince Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far right group.In turn, the US president has described Britain as being in political \"turmoil\", criticised its defence spending and shown no enthusiasm for coming to visit: in the 18 months of his presidency, Mr Trump has chosen to visit 17 other countries first.Whatever this relationship is, it can hardly be described as special.So this trip is about ticking a diplomatic box, getting a visit out of the way before its further delay became politically embarrassing.And as working visits go, it is on the minimal side: no Downing Street barbecue, no cabinet visit, no speech to both Houses of Parliament.The diplomatic aim will be to get through the visit without any gaffes, without upsetting the president, and without him saying anything disobliging about Brexit or a future trade deal.The UK and the US do have a good relationship at an institutional level, in the fields of defence, security and intelligence. The tricky bit is always the politics and the personalities.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout 150 guests are understood to have agreed to attend the dinner at Blenheim Palace, including cabinet members and business leaders.\\nUK protests greet Trump\\'s \\'state visit on the sly\\'\\nPolice beds for Trump visit \\'a disgrace\\'\\nTrump raises questions over Brexit plans\\nOnly one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. \\nGuess who\\'s coming to dinner with Trump\\nTrump talks of UK \\'turmoil\\' ahead of trip\\n\\'Trump Baby\\' balloon banned from Turnberry\\nThe UK-US trade relationship in five charts\\nStormy Daniels arrested in Ohio - lawyer\\nThe pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM\\'s country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary.The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump\\'s Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private.The Police Federation has warned the visit will put \"unquestionable pressure\" on UK police forces as tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Friday.It has also complained that 300 officers working during the visit will have to sleep on camp beds in a gymnasium that has no hot water and restricted access to hot food.\\n\\n\\nImage copyright\\nGetty Images\\n\\n\\nImage caption\\n\\n                    Security has been stepped up outside the US ambassador\\'s residence in London where Mr Trump is staying\\n                \\n\\nSmaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool.Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president\\'s visit.But the balloon will not be allowed to fly over his Turnberry golf course, Police Scotland have said.\\n'"
